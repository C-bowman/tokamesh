Mesh Construction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``tokamesh.construction`` module provides tools for constructing and refining
triangular meshes for use in tomography problems.

Example code for mesh construction & refinement can be found in the
`mesh construction jupyter notebook demo <https://github.com/C-bowman/tokamesh/blob/main/demos/mesh_construction_demo.ipynb>`_.

Mesh construction is handled by the ``mesh_generator`` function:

.. autofunction:: tokamesh.construction.mesh_generator
