    Generate a triangular mesh which fills the space inside a given boundary using a 2-stage
    process. First, a mesh of equilateral triangles is created which fills the space up to a
    chosen minimum distance from the boundary. An irregular mesh is then generated which fills
    the space between the central equilateral mesh and the boundary. The two meshes are then
    merged, and the resulting mesh is returned.

    :param R_boundary: \
        The major-radius values of the boundary as a 1D numpy array.

    :param z_boundary: \
        The z-height values of the boundary as a 1D numpy array.

    :param resolution: \
        The side-length of triangles in the central equilateral mesh.

    :param edge_resolution: \
        Sets the target area of triangles in the irregular edge mesh, which fills the space between
        the central equilateral mesh and the boundary. The `Triangle` C-code, which is used to
        generate the irregular mesh, will attempt to construct triangles with areas equal to that
        of an equilateral triangle with side length ``edge_resolution``. If not specified, the value
        passed as the ``resolution`` argument is used instead.

    :param edge_padding: \
        A multiplicative factor which defines the minimum allowed distance between a
        vertex in the central equilateral mesh and the boundary such that
        ``min_distance = edge_padding * resolution``. No vertices in the central equilateral
        mesh will be closer to the boundary than ``min_distance``.

    :param edge_max_area: \
        A multiplicative factor which sets the maximum allowed area of triangles in the
        irregular edge mesh, such that no triangle will have an area larger than
        ``edge_max_area`` times the target area set by the ``edge_resolution`` argument.

    :param rotation: \
        Angle (in radians) by which the orientations of triangles in the central
        equilateral mesh are rotated, relative to their default orientation.

    :return: \
        A tuple containing ``R_vert``, ``z_vert`` and ``triangles``.
        ``R_vert`` is the major-radius of the vertices as a 1D array. ``z_vert`` the is
        z-height of the vertices as a 1D array. ``triangles`` is a 2D array of integers
        of shape ``(N,3)`` specifying the indices of the vertices which form each triangle
        in the mesh, where ``N`` is the total number of triangles.
